            <h1>E-Commerce</h1>

            <p class="lead">For over two decades, I've been helping merchants build, fix, and scale their online businesses. My company <a href="https://creativestyle.de">creativestyle</a> — with 100+ experts in Munich and Krakow — is dedicated to solving the real problems e-commerce teams face every day.</p>

            <!-- PROBLEMS WE SOLVE -->
            <section class="ecom-section">
                <h2>Problems We Solve</h2>
                <p>If any of these sound familiar, we should talk:</p>
                <ul class="problem-list">
                    <li>Your replatforming project is stuck — or terrifying to start</li>
                    <li>Slow page loads are killing your conversions</li>
                    <li>You've lost control of your own platform</li>
                    <li>Competitors are outpacing you digitally</li>
                    <li>You can't hire enough developers — or the right ones</li>
                    <li>Off-the-shelf solutions don't fit your business</li>
                    <li>Development costs are spiraling out of control</li>
                    <li>Your shop looks like it's from 2015</li>
                    <li>Your B2B sales are still stuck in emails and phone calls</li>
                </ul>

            <!-- OUR APPROACH -->
            <section class="ecom-section">
                <h2>Open Source & European Platforms</h2>
                <p>We believe in technology that you actually own. No vendor lock-ins, no surprise license fees, no dependency on a single provider's roadmap.</p>
                <p>Our expertise spans the leading open source and European e-commerce platforms:</p>
                <ul class="platform-list">
                    <li><a href="https://magento.com">Magento</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.shopware.com">Shopware</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://commercetools.com">commercetools</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.novomind.com">Novomind iSHOP</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://sylius.com">Sylius</a></li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE -->
            <section class="ecom-section">
                <h2>Customer Experience First</h2>
                <p>Here's the truth: your customers don't care about your tech stack. They care about how it feels to browse, search, buy, and get support.</p>
                <p>That's why we focus relentlessly on Customer Experience across the entire journey — not just the checkout button. Technology is a means to an end, not the end itself.</p>
                <p>We regularly publish <strong>Customer Experience Reports</strong> to share insights and benchmarks from the industry.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- INDEPENDENCE -->
            <section class="ecom-section">
                <h2>Own Your Platform</h2>
                <p>Too many companies are trapped — locked into expensive licenses, dependent on vendors who control their roadmap, unable to access their own data.</p>
                <p>We help companies break free. To own their platform, their data, and their future. That's not just good business — it's digital sovereignty in practice.</p>
