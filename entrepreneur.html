            <h1>Entrepreneur</h1>

            <p class="lead">Born in Poland. Raised in Bavaria. Building digital businesses since 2001. Here's my journey from curious teenager to running a 100+ person company.</p>

            <!-- THE BEGINNING -->
            <section class="story-section">
                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <p>It was 2001. The dot-com bubble had just burst, and everyone said the internet was over. I didn't get the memo.</p>
                <p>While others saw wreckage, I saw opportunity. The web wasn't dying — it was just getting started. And I wanted to be part of building it.</p>
                <p>That year, I became a web entrepreneur. No business plan, no investors, no safety net. Just a deep conviction that the internet would change everything — and the stubborn determination to figure out how.</p>

                <h2>Building creativestyle</h2>
                <img src="images/creativestyle.jpg" alt="creativestyle team" class="section-image">
                <p>What started as a one-person operation grew into <a href="https://creativestyle.de">creativestyle</a> — now a team of over 100 e-commerce experts across Munich and Krakow.</p>
                <p>We've helped brands like Media-Markt, Saturn, Miele, Mammut, and many others build digital commerce that actually works. Not flashy demos. Not PowerPoint strategies. Real platforms, real revenue, real results.</p>
                <p>The secret? We never forgot what it felt like to be small. To have limited resources. To need every project to succeed. That hunger never left — it just scaled.</p>

            <!-- JOINING SMILE -->
            <section class="story-section">
                <h2>Joining Forces</h2>
                <p>In 2022, creativestyle became part of the <a href="https://www.smile.eu">Smile Group</a> — Europe's largest network of open source integrators. It wasn't an exit. It was an expansion.</p>
                <p>Suddenly, we weren't just a German-Polish agency anymore. We were part of something bigger: a European alliance committed to open source, digital sovereignty, and technology that serves people — not the other way around.</p>
                <p>Same mission. Bigger playground.</p>

            <!-- SENSIOLABS -->
            <section class="story-section">
                <h2>SensioLabs & Symfony</h2>
                <p>I also serve as General Manager of <a href="https://sensiolabs.de">SensioLabs Deutschland</a> — the company behind the Symfony PHP framework that powers millions of websites worldwide.</p>
                <p>It's a privilege to work at the intersection of open source and enterprise. To help companies adopt technology that's transparent, community-driven, and built to last.</p>

            <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->
            <section class="story-section">
                <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
                <p><strong>Simplicity over complexity.</strong> The best solutions are the ones you can explain in one sentence.</p>
                <p><strong>Ownership over dependency.</strong> Build things you control. Use tools that don't control you.</p>
                <p><strong>Action over perfection.</strong> Ship early, learn fast, improve constantly. The market is the ultimate teacher.</p>
                <p><strong>People over processes.</strong> Great companies are built by great people who give a damn. Everything else is just scaffolding.</p>

            <!-- ROOTS -->
            <section class="story-section">
                <h2>Roots</h2>
                <p>I was born in Poland and grew up in Bavaria, Germany. That mix shaped me more than any business book ever could.</p>
                <p>From Poland: resilience, resourcefulness, and a healthy skepticism of the status quo.</p>
                <p>From Bavaria: precision, reliability, and an obsession with getting things right.</p>
                <p>Today, I call Munich home. But my heart — and my company — spans borders.</p>
