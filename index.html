                        <p>There are countless agencies promising digital transformation. Flashy pitches, complex frameworks, and enterprise buzzwords. You've probably heard them all.</p>

                        <p><strong>Unfortunately, most <a href="#">e-commerce</a> projects end up over-engineered, over-budget, or just overcomplicated. Sound familiar?</strong></p>

                        <p>Not here. As an <a href="#">entrepreneur</a>, I believe in straightforward solutions, built on 25 years of hands-on experience. Longevity isn't luck — it's proof of what actually works.</p>

                        <p><strong>I'm a strong advocate for <a href="digital-sovereignty.html">digital sovereignty</a></strong> — open source foundations, data ownership, and technology that serves people, not the other way around.</p>

                        <p>Beyond business, I find balance in <a href="music.html">music</a> and <a href="#">games</a>. Creativity and play aren't distractions — they're essential to how I think and build.</p>

                        <p>So take a look around. If what you see resonates, let's talk.</p>
